Files are the silent historians of a computer system.
Every saved document, every compiled program, every log entryâ€”they all live as files, tucked away in the depths of storage. 
Some hold memories, like photos and journals; others hold secrets, like passwords and encrypted data.
Whether text or binary, visible or hidden, files quietly shape the digital world, preserving every action, every thought, one byte at a time.
